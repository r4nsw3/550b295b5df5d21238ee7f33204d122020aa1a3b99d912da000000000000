  |   In Streets of Red - Devil's Dare Deluxe, the only thing scarier       |
  |   than being eaten alive is running out of quarters! A permadeath       |
  |   multiplayer horror beat'em up that bestows players with the skills    |
  |   of retro gaming heroes in a fight against a legion of undead          |
  |   monstrosities.                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Streets of Red was designed to be played over and over again, with    |
  |   each run offering up the potential for new content. Six unique        |
  |   playable characters and an ever-growing level selection work to       |
  |   keep the gameplay from getting old and rotten, while the easy to      |
  |   learn but hard to master combat system allows for plenty of depth.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With every kill, you earn cash that can be spent on upgrades, or to   |
  |   revive yourself when you die. You better learn how to make cash       |
  |   fast and spend it smart in Streets of Red because when you're dead,   |
  |   your save data dies with you. The chills, thrills, bills, and         |
  |   opportunity to learn new skills here won't stop until every street    |
  |   runs red with blood! Are you up for the challenge of an               |
  |   anti-lifetime?                                                        |
